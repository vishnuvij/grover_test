# GROVER model test
GROVER Tutorial â€“ Fine-tuning with 2 Epochs
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial for fine-tuning the GROVER (Graph Representation frOm self-superVised mEssage passing tRansformer) model using 2 training epochs. GROVER is a pre-trained model for molecular property prediction.
This notebook demonstrates:

Loading and setting up the GROVER model environment.

Preparing molecular datasets for fine-tuning.

Training the model for 2 epochs to illustrate the tuning process.

Evaluating the performance using appropriate metrics.
